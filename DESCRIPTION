Title: Causal Mediation Effects For Partially Linear Models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Oliver Hines
Maintainer: Oliver Hines <oliver.hines@lshtm.ac.uk>
Description: This package can be used to estimate causal mediation effects
    (natural direct and indirect effects) in models where the outcome is modelled
    by a linear model which include mediator and exposure as covariates.
    The current package includes G-estimation methods, non-parametric influence 
    curve based methods (TTS) and methods based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).
    Each of these require different combinations of mediator and exposure models,
    as described in the documentation.
